Short_Description: Slides for the GeoIPS Reader Tutorial
Prerequisites: For interactive/follow-along components, a working GeoIPS installation, along with
a sample plugin directory (e.g., cool_plugins) is required. Additionally, GREAT.zip will need to be
downloaded and placed in your $GEOIPS_TESTDATA_DIR/test_data_fl. Other locations are acceptable, but
note that you will have to adjust some of the runtime scripts to account for that.
